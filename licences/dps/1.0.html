							<h2>About this Licence</h2>
							<p>
								This Licence was derived from—and is intended to convey equivalent permissions to—the
								<a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/1/open-government-licence.htm">Open Government Licence</a> developed by <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk">the National Archives</a> and the controller of Her Majesty’s Stationery Office (HMSO) for use by the public sector through the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/government-licensing/the-framework.htm">UK Government Licensing Framework</a> (UKGLF). In contrast to the OGL 1.0, the Digital Public Space Licence, version 1.0 is intended to support the licensing of open data and other assets by any organisation. This section does not form part of the
							Licence itself and is included for convenience.
							</p>
						</section>
					
						<section id="attribution">
							<h2>Example of an attribution statement</h2>

							<p>You are not required to use the form of attribution below when publishing your
							works, but you are encouraged to. This section does not form part of the
							Licence itself and is included for convenience.
							</p>					
							<blockquote class="callout highlight-block">

						<section id="contributor">
							<h2>Example of a contributor clause for websites</h2>

							<p>
							The below clause has been designed to be inserted into a website’s terms and
							conditions in order to ensure that contributors to the data that you publish
							agree to their submissions being included within the data without specific
							individual attribution. This is particularly useful where you are expecting
							submissions from sufficient numbers of people that individual attribution
							becomes unwieldy. This section does not form part of the Licence itself and
							is included for convenience.
							</p>
							<blockquote class="callout highlight-block">
								<p>
									By making contributions to this website, you agree to grant <i>[website
									operator]</i> a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty free license allowing those
									contributions to be published, including as part of a composite work
									including other contributions from you and others, under the terms of the
									Digital Public Space Licence, version 1.0 (“the Licence”), and that you
									agree to those contributions being attributed to “<i>[website operator]</i> and
									its contributors”.  You may obtain a copy of the Licence at:

									Any copyright in your contribution will remain with you and this permission
